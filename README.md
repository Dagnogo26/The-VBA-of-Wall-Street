# The-VBA-of-Wall-Street

This exercise is about calculating yearly change, percentage change and total volume per ticker each year from 2014 to 2016. The exercise enables us to put into practise our knowledge concerning for loops and conditionals using "if statement".
The bonus segment allows us to retrieve highest and lowest percentage change as well as greates total volume and provide the ticker associated to each.
